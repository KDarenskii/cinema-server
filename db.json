The film is based on Stephen King's novel The Green Mile.\n\nThe main role was played by the legendary Tom Hanks, who has long been included in the Hollywood list as one of the best charismatic and talented actors. The events in the film unfold in 1935, Tom played the role of the head of the prison block of death row named Paul Edgecombe. The work is not the most pleasant, because every day you have to deal with disgusting personalities sitting in prison cells, although not all of these personalities are disgusting, some of them look quite normal people, but you never know what they are thinking, after all, these people have committed murders, and Paul also has problems with health.\n\nEverything changes when the giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought to prison one day, and from that very moment a lot will change in life for Paul and his work colleagues.",

The film is based on Stephen King's novel The Green Mile.\n\nThe main role was played by the legendary Tom Hanks, who has long been included in the Hollywood list as one of the best charismatic and talented actors. The events in the film unfold in 1935, Tom played the role of the head of the prison block of death row named Paul Edgecombe. The work is not the most pleasant, because every day you have to deal with disgusting personalities sitting in prison cells, although not all of these personalities are disgusting, some of them look quite normal people, but you never know what they are thinking, after all, these people have committed murders, and Paul also has problems with health.\n\nEverything changes when the giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought to prison one day, and from that very moment a lot will change in life for Paul and his work colleagues.",
